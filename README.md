# landing-page
This project is part of The Odin Project - Foundatins course. The goal is to create a personalized landing page using mainly flexbox and other css properties. The result should be as similar as possible to the given design. 

# My version:
After matching the landing page to the given template I personalized it to my liking. Because I play League of Legends I fitted it into the theme of the develop Riot Games and added some of my favorite heroes from the game.
